# Forest_fire_detection
Wildfire Detection using Deep Learning ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ² This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect wildfires using images. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains two classes: fire and nofire. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras and includes image visualization and GPU support for training.
